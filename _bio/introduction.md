Hi, I'm Arushi! I currently work as a Trading Analyst at [LMCG Investments](https://lmcg.com/alternative-investments/), a structured credit hedge fund with $5B AUM. I build trading algorithms and models and work with portfolio managers to generate new strategies on generating alpha. I'm fascinated by the interesection of capital markets and code, especially within the world of bonds and private credit. 

I am a 2024 graduate from the University of Pennsylvania with a B.S.E in Computer Science and minors in Economics and Data Science. At Penn, I was a teaching assistant for an Intro CS course, wrote for the [Daily Pennsylvanian](https://www.thedp.com/page/search?q=Arushi+Srivastava#gsc.tab=0&gsc.q=Arushi%20Srivastava&gsc.page=1), and managed the website for [Theta Tau](https://www.upennthetatau.com/), Penn's engineering fraternity. 

In my free time, I'm exploring the best cafes in NYC, on my yoga mat, or experimenting in the kitchen. I created this space to share my projects, thoughts on quantitative finance, and (hopefully) blog my various thoughts. Coffee recommendations always welcome at arushi.mail16@gmail.com.
