Hi, I'm Arushi! I currently work as a Trading Analyst at [LMCG Investments](https://lmcg.com/alternative-investments/), a structured credit hedge fund, where I've built trading algorithms and models and worked with Portfolio Managers to generate new strategies on generating alpha. I am curious about the interesection of financial markets and quantitative analysis, especially within the world of bonds and private credit. 

I am a 2024 graduate from the University of Pennsylvania with a B.S.E in Computer Science and minors in Economics and Data Science. At Penn, I was a teaching assistant for an Intro CS course with Swapneel Sheth, wrote for the [Daily Pennsylvanian](https://www.thedp.com/page/search?q=Arushi+Srivastava#gsc.tab=0&gsc.q=Arushi%20Srivastava&gsc.page=1), and managed the website for [Theta Tau](https://www.upennthetatau.com/), the engineering fraternity. 

In my free time, you'll find me exploring the best coffee shops and bakeries in NYC, experimenting with new recipes in the kitchen, or on my yoga mat. I created this space to share my thoughts on the world of quantitative finance, document my projects, and (hopefully) blog my various thoughts. Feel free to reach out to me at arushi.mail16@gmail.com.
