Hi, I'm Arushi! I currently work as a Trading Analyst at [LMCG Investments](https://lmcg.com/alternative-investments/), a $5B structured credit hedge fund, where I architect algorithms and build analytical frameworks that help shape investment decisions. I love the intellectual puzzle of markets - finding signal in noise, translating messy data into conviction, and figuring out how capital actually moves through the economy.

I graduated from the University of Pennsylvania in 2024 with a B.S.E in Computer Science and minors in Economics and Data Science. During my time at Penn, I was a teaching assistant for an Intro CS course, wrote for the [Daily Pennsylvanian](https://www.thedp.com/page/search?q=Arushi+Srivastava#gsc.tab=0&gsc.q=Arushi%20Srivastava&gsc.page=1), and was a member of [Theta Tau](https://www.upennthetatau.com/), Penn's engineering fraternity. 

In my free time, I'm hunting down the best coffee shops in NYC, sweating in my hot yoga class, or experimenting in the kitchen (with occasional success). I created this space to document what I'm building, share thoughts on markets and investing, and publish the occasional opinionated take. Coffee recommendations always welcome at arushi.mail16@gmail.com.
